# claude_learning

Claude Code skills and subagents for one-task-at-a-time engineering in an existing codebase: understand the repo, write its project docs, clarify the task, plan it, then build it with tests and independent review. Optional guardrail hooks enforce the rules the skills state.

| Skill | Use it to | Writes files |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `/spec-interview <task> [plan.md]` | plan a task or a new project: asks what the code can't answer, then writes acceptance criteria (ACs), design decisions and buildable steps | the plan file you name |
| `/spec-prd [sources]` | create or update the project overview and context: purpose, users, scope, flow, constraints | `docs/PRD.md` |
| `/spec-arch <plan.md>` | create or update the architecture from the code and the plan: repository structure, components, data, flows, interfaces, configuration | `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` |
| `/spec-claudemd <plan.md>` | create or refresh a lean, verified `CLAUDE.md` from the code, the plan and the two docs | `CLAUDE.md` |
| `/build-phase <task>` | implement one task end to end: tests first, then independent review, fixes and re-review | code and tests, never committed |
| `/followup explore: \| decide: \| implement: <text>` | answer, decide or change something in the middle of a session | only in implement mode |

The subagents are the read-only reviewers that build-phase and followup spawn: `criteria-auditor`, `gap-hunter` and `convention-checker` in round 1, and `gap-rechecker` in re-check rounds.

### Which skill when

| You want to | Use |
| --- | --- |
| understand code, or weigh a tradeoff | `/followup explore: ...` or `/followup decide: ...` |
| change 1-3 files | `/followup implement: ...` |
| build a feature or a multi-file change | `/spec-interview`, then one `/build-phase` line per step, each in a fresh session |
| write or refresh the project docs | `/spec-prd`, `/spec-arch`, `/spec-claudemd` |
| analysis, writing or research outside a code repository | no skill: these skills assume a git repository with tests |

Start Claude Code in the repository root. Claude Code loads `CLAUDE.md`, project settings and memory from the session folder, and the hooks treat that folder as the project. build-phase and followup warn when the session started outside the repository, then continue with `git -C`.

## Requirements

- Claude Code 2.1.295 or later. The hooks use `onFailure`, which older versions ignore.
- `git`, and `python3` on your PATH for the guardrail hooks.
- macOS or Linux. On Windows the hooks need Git Bash; that setup has not been tried.

## Install

Pick a scope. Skills, agents and shared files must sit side by side in the same `.claude` folder, because the skills load `../../shared/` relative to themselves.

**Just you, every project:**

```bash
git clone git@github.com:shahpratikr/claude_learning.git
cd claude_learning
mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills ~/.claude/agents ~/.claude/shared
cp -R skills/. ~/.claude/skills/
cp agents/*.md ~/.claude/agents/
cp -R shared/. ~/.claude/shared/
```

**A whole team, in one repository:** copy the same three folders into that repository's `.claude/` folder and commit them. Everyone who opens the repository in Claude Code gets the skills.

```bash
cd /path/to/your/repo && mkdir -p .claude
cp -R /path/to/claude_learning/{skills,agents,shared} .claude/
```

Then start a new Claude Code session.

**Upgrading from an older copy:** `validate-phase` has been merged into `build-phase`. Delete the old folder: `rm -r ~/.claude/skills/validate-phase`.

### Recommended settings

**Fall back to sonnet when opus isn't available.** The skills run on opus and the reviewers on sonnet. A skill whose model your account or provider doesn't offer fails with "There's an issue with the selected model". It does not fall back on its own, and the `model:` field takes only one model. Add a fallback chain to `~/.claude/settings.json`, or for a team to the repository's `.claude/settings.json`:

```json
{ "fallbackModel": ["sonnet"] }
```

Then a skill or reviewer whose model is unavailable or overloaded runs on sonnet instead of failing. Claude Code tries the original model again at the start of your next turn.

**Turn fork mode off.** This setting matters most. build-phase waits for its reviewers. In interactive sessions (terminal, VS Code, desktop app), Claude can only wait for a subagent when fork mode is off. If it can't wait, the reviewers' reports arrive later as new turns. The rest of the build then runs without the skill's tool pre-approvals, so you get permission prompts, and on your default model and effort instead of the skill's. Measured on 19 builds with fork mode on: every one left the skill at the first reviewer hand-back or background notification, and 35-45% of each build ran outside it. The skills also never run commands in the background, for the same reason.

To turn fork mode off, add this to `~/.claude/settings.json`:

```json
{ "env": { "CLAUDE_CODE_FORK_SUBAGENT": "0" } }
```

Both settings together:

```json
{ "env": { "CLAUDE_CODE_FORK_SUBAGENT": "0" }, "fallbackModel": ["sonnet"] }
```

## First run: guardrails

build-phase, followup, spec-interview, spec-prd, spec-arch and spec-claudemd carry guardrail hooks. The first time you run one of them, it checks whether the hook scripts are installed:

1. **Already installed** in `<project>/.claude/hooks/guardrails/` or `~/.claude/hooks/guardrails/`: it uses them and asks nothing.
2. **Not installed**: it asks whether you want guardrails. If you say yes, it asks where to put them:
   - `~/.claude/hooks/guardrails`: every project. Recommended.
   - `<project>/.claude/hooks/guardrails`: this project only.
   - any other folder.
3. It copies the scripts there, checks that they run, and continues your task.

Notes on the answer:
- **A folder of your own** is written into the `hooks` section of every installed skill and agent. It takes effect from the next skill run. The two standard folders work at once, with no edit.
- **"No"** is remembered, and the skills stop asking. To turn guardrails on later, run `python3 ~/.claude/shared/guardrails/configure.py --dir ~/.claude/hooks/guardrails`, using your install's `shared/` path.
- **For a team**, install the scripts into the repository's `.claude/hooks/guardrails/` and commit them. Nobody gets asked, and everyone runs the same guardrails.

What the guardrails do, at every tool call:
- **Deny:**
  - destructive git: `reset --hard`, `checkout --`, `restore`, `clean -f`, `stash drop`;
  - `git add -A` and force pushes;
  - recursive `rm` of `/`, `~`, `.` or a folder that holds your home folder, including through a variable or `cd` earlier in the command;
  - `curl ... | sh`;
  - reading `.env` files, SSH private keys or cloud credentials through Bash. The Read tool isn't hooked: to cover it too, add the `permissions.deny` rules from `shared/guardrails/settings.example.json` to your settings;
  - writing a credential into any file;
  - editing Claude Code's own settings or hooks.
- **Ask you first:** every `git commit`, adding a new dependency (`npm install <pkg>`, `pip install <pkg>`, `go get`, ...), and other recursive deletes.
- **Let through:** recursive deletes at least two levels inside the temp folder, such as a session scratchpad or a `mktemp -d` folder, so reviewers' probe and snapshot folders never wait for a click.

Hooks run outside the model, so a prompt can't talk its way past them. They match command text, though, so they are a strong default rather than a sandbox. For an OS-level boundary, also turn on Claude Code's `/sandbox`.

Optional: to guard sessions that never use these skills, merge `shared/guardrails/settings.example.json` into `~/.claude/settings.json`. It adds the same hooks, plus a prompt check that stops pasted credentials before they reach the model.

## Using the skills

**Plan and project docs.** Each skill writes one file, and the files never repeat each other:
- `/spec-interview` writes the plan, at the path you name: ACs, design decisions, steps and `/build-phase` lines. If you don't name a path, it asks.
- `/spec-prd` writes `docs/PRD.md`: what the project is, for whom and why. It has no directory structure, design or plan.
- `/spec-arch <plan.md>` writes `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` from the code and the plan's design decisions.
- `/spec-claudemd <plan.md>` writes `CLAUDE.md` from the code, the plan and the two docs: the commands, test rules, conventions, invariants and constraints the other skills read.

For a new project, run them in that order. Each one updates its own file in place on later runs. The docs take decisions from the plan, never its ACs, steps or `/build-phase` lines, and never mention the plan, because a plan goes stale when its task ends. `shared/project-docs.md` decides which file owns which fact.

`CLAUDE.md` is enough to make a change on its own, and it imports nothing. An `@` import would load the whole PRD and ARCHITECTURE.md into every session. So `CLAUDE.md` holds the rules every change must keep (invariants, import direction, where new files go) and names the two docs by path, with the section to read for each code area. ARCHITECTURE.md explains how the code is built and why.

A typical task:

1. `/spec-claudemd` once, if the repository has no `CLAUDE.md`. build-phase reads the test command from it.
2. `/spec-interview <task> <plan.md>` asks every question the code can't answer, writes the plan file, and prints a ready-to-paste `/build-phase ...` line, or one `/build-phase Step N of M ...` line per step for a bigger change.
3. Paste the `/build-phase` line. It runs to the end without approvals and stops only for questions it can't settle from the code. A task of more than about 10 production files stops at a question first and offers a `/spec-interview` line to split it: every review round re-reads the whole change, so a 100-file run takes hours.
4. Review the change and commit it yourself. For multi-step plans, commit each step before starting the next.
5. `/followup` for anything that comes up mid-session. `implement:` changes go through the same review loop as build-phase.

**Questions.** Every skill asks through Claude Code's question picker: up to 4 questions per dialog, blocking ones first, with the recommended answer listed first. Choose "Other" to type your own answer. Keep-or-cut lists arrive as checkboxes, and a question that depends on another answer waits for the next dialog. Only open input with no likely answers, such as the task itself, is asked in plain text. Answers carry across skills in the same session, so nothing is asked twice. Where the picker isn't available, such as in `claude -p`, the skill prints the questions as text and waits for a reply like `defaults` or `defaults except Q3=B`.

### What build-phase does

1. Snapshots the working tree without touching it (`git stash create`), so the change can be reviewed with no commit. Files you had already modified stay off-limits.
2. Recon, then a baseline run of tests, lint and typecheck. Existing failures are recorded, not fixed.
3. Prints a Task Brief and test plan, including a table of the input variants each changed format must handle and a pre-mortem per AC. Then it applies the size gate, writes failing tests first and implements until they pass.
4. Runs a can-fail pass: it breaks each changed condition, boundary and guard one at a time and checks that a test fails. Each surviving break gets a test, or a recorded reason why it can't change behavior.
5. Runs a validation loop of at most 3 rounds. Round 1 is a full review. A small change (at most 3 files and 80 lines) gets `gap-hunter` alone; anything larger gets three read-only reviewers in parallel:
   - `criteria-auditor`: is every AC implemented, tested and verifiable, and did anything in the task go missing?
   - `gap-hunter`: every untested scenario, defect and contradiction, with no cap on findings. It proves suspected defects with small probe scripts in the scratchpad;
   - `convention-checker`: project conventions and invariants, each violation marked BLOCKING or MINOR.
   Reviewers see the task, your confirmed answers, the diff and the test and can-fail results, never the builder's reasoning, variant table or fix plans. They never re-run the suite.
   Before any fix, build-phase writes a fix plan: one entry per MUST-FIX finding, with the root cause, every sibling location, the variants, the callers at risk, the failing tests and a pre-mortem. It checks the plan against the code, corrects what is missing, malformed or wrong, prints a `fix-plan check` line, and only then edits.
   Round 2 re-checks. build-phase confirms each fix with evidence (a passing test, a clean search), then spawns `gap-rechecker` on what the fixes changed. It adds the other two reviewers only when an AC changed, a file was created, or a fix couldn't be confirmed. Round 3 runs only when round 2 found a HIGH, overturned a confirmation, or left a production fix it can't prove with a test and killed breaks. After the last review, no production code changes, so nothing reaches you unreviewed.
6. Prints a report with these parts:
   - the verdict, `PASS` or `NEEDS REVIEW`;
   - the AC-to-test map and test results;
   - each validation round;
   - anything that needs your decision;
   - `git diff <BASE>` to review the change, a one-line undo command, and a suggested commit message.
   It never stages, commits, pushes or switches branches.

### Models, effort and cost

Opus where a skill writes code, makes design decisions, or writes a file every later session relies on. Sonnet where the work is checking against explicit rules or turning given sources into prose. Both `model:` and `effort:` in the frontmatter are honored: a skill's values override the session's for as long as the run stays inside the skill.

| File | Model | Effort |
| --- | --- | --- |
| build-phase | opus | EFFORT_BUILD |
| followup | opus | EFFORT_FOLLOWUP |
| spec-interview, spec-arch, spec-claudemd | opus | high |
| spec-prd | sonnet | high |
| gap-hunter (round 1) | sonnet | xhigh |
| gap-rechecker (round 2 and 3) | sonnet | medium |
| criteria-auditor, convention-checker | sonnet | medium |

EFFORT_NOTE

Measured cost before these settings: 15 build-phase runs averaged $21.7, from $11.7 to $39.4. About two thirds of it was re-reading context, not new output: thinking stays in context and is paid for again on every call, so effort drives both. The size of the change drives the rest: keep each run within the size gate.

To measure your own runs: `python3 ~/.claude/shared/tools/measure_sessions.py --filter <repo-name>`. It prints cost, lines added, effort, model, calls that ran outside the skill, peak context, each reviewer's model, effort and foreground or background shape, the round records and the fix-plan check lines.

## Updating

Pull the repository and copy the folders again, as in Install. Re-copying resets every `hooks` section to its default:
- guardrails in the two standard folders are found again automatically;
- if you chose a folder of your own, the next guarded skill asks again. Give it the same folder; the scripts are refreshed in place.

Copying never deletes. Remove skills and agents the repository no longer ships by hand: `rm -r ~/.claude/skills/{analyze-repo,validate-phase}` and `rm ~/.claude/agents/{spec-validator,test-reporter}.md`.

A `CLAUDE.md` written by an older spec-claudemd `@`-imports the PRD and ARCHITECTURE.md, and its invariants still sit in ARCHITECTURE.md. To move them, run `/spec-claudemd <plan.md>`, then `/spec-arch <plan.md>`.

## Uninstall

```bash
cd ~/.claude
rm -r skills/{build-phase,followup,spec-arch,spec-claudemd,spec-interview,spec-prd}
rm agents/{convention-checker,criteria-auditor,gap-hunter,gap-rechecker}.md
rm -r shared/guardrails shared/tools shared/guardrails-setup.md shared/project-docs.md shared/question-round.md shared/scenario-checklist.md shared/validation-loop.md
rm -r hooks/guardrails
```

## Troubleshooting

| You see | Cause | Fix |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `PreToolUse:Bash hook error: guardrails: guard_bash.py not found in <folder>` on every call | the folder you chose for guardrails was moved or deleted | in a terminal: `python3 ~/.claude/shared/guardrails/configure.py --dir "<folder>"`, or `--off` |
| a call denied with `[guardrail:<rule>]` | a guardrail did its job | run the command yourself if you really mean it |
| "There's an issue with the selected model (claude-opus-…)" when a skill starts | your account or provider doesn't offer opus, and no fallback is set | add `"fallbackModel": ["sonnet"]` (Recommended settings) |
| permission prompts, or your default model, after build-phase's reviewers report | fork mode is on, so the reviewers ran in the background | set `CLAUDE_CODE_FORK_SUBAGENT=0` (Recommended settings); `measure_sessions.py` shows `background` per reviewer |
| "This session started outside <repo>" | Claude Code was started in a parent folder | start it in the repository root, so its `CLAUDE.md`, settings and memory load |
| a project's copy of a skill doesn't run | a personal skill of the same name in `~/.claude/skills` wins | delete one of them; for agents it's the reverse: the project copy wins |
| "can't find scenario-checklist.md / validation-loop.md" | `shared/` isn't next to `skills/` | copy `shared/` as in Install |
| a reviewer or helper agent can write files | an old agent file with `allowedTools:`, a field Claude Code silently ignores | re-copy `agents/`; the field is `tools:` |

To see the guardrails' decisions, read `guardrail-hooks.jsonl` in the `logs/` folder next to the installed scripts. Secrets are masked before anything is written.

## Repository layout

| Path | What it is |
| --- | --- |
| `skills/<name>/SKILL.md` | the six skills |
| `agents/*.md` | the reviewers; none has write tools or changes the repository. gap-hunter's and gap-rechecker's probe scripts go in the scratchpad |
| `shared/scenario-checklist.md` | test-scenario categories used by build-phase, followup, the reviewers and spec-interview |
| `shared/validation-loop.md` | the can-fail pass and the review, fix and re-review procedure used by build-phase and followup |
| `shared/project-docs.md` | which of the plan file, `PRD.md`, `ARCHITECTURE.md` and `CLAUDE.md` owns each kind of fact, used by the four spec skills |
| `shared/question-round.md` | how every skill asks questions: the picker, the recommended-first order and the text fallback |
| `shared/guardrails-setup.md` | the first-run guardrails questions |
| `shared/guardrails/` | the hook scripts, `configure.py` (installs them and points the skills at them), and `settings.example.json` |
| `shared/tools/measure_sessions.py` | measures runs from Claude Code's transcripts: cost, effort, skill escapes, context, reviewers, rounds |

## Contributing

- Edit the files in this repository, not your installed copies, then re-install.
- Every guarded skill and agent shares the same hooks block, starting with `GR_DIR=UNSET;`. `configure.py` rewrites that marker, so keep the block identical across files.
- To try changed hook scripts without installing them, start Claude Code with `GUARDRAILS_HOOKS_DIR="$PWD/shared/guardrails" claude`.
- To see what a hook decides without running Claude: `python3 shared/guardrails/guard_bash.py --dry-run "git push -f origin main"`.
- Claude Code ignores frontmatter fields it doesn't recognise, without an error. Check field names against the [skills](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/skills) and [subagents](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/sub-agents) references.
